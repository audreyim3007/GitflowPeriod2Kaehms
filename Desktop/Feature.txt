This feature branch was created using the gitflow extentions:
git flow feature start feature_branch
git flow feature finish feature_branch

Each new feature should reside in its own branch, which can be pushed to the central repository for backup/collaboration. But, instead of branching off of master, feature branches use develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop. Features should never interact directly with master.
