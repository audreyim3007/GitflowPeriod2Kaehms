Description of GitFlow workflow: Gitflow is a branching model utilized for git and mainly used for collaboration/development teams. Gitflow utilizes the same commands and concepts as the Feature Branch Workflow. Furthermore, it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. 

A develop branch is created from master
A release branch is created from develop
Feature branches are created from develop
When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch
When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and master
If an issue in master is detected a hotfix branch is created from master
Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and master

Key Differences from basic workflow, and key use cases
Gitflow is essentially an abstract idea of a Git workflow
Gitflow assigns specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact
